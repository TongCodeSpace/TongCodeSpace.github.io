Welcome to the Yin and Yang Obsidian theme! This theme was created with both dark mode and light mode in mind. Hopefully, you too will enjoy the stark contrast in colors.

## Plugins to Use

- Style Settings: I've added a ton of customizable features with the theme, including the ability to change base hue and saturation ðŸ¥³.
- Hider: This will allow you to hide various elements of the Obsidian UI for a cleaner and more minimal workspace ðŸ¤—.
